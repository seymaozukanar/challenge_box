- First, go to the corresponding file of this page from algorand/docs and find â€˜index.mdâ€™

- Choose the part of the page where you want the box to reside

- * Copy-paste the following code snippet and enter the slug of the challenge that you want to insert:

    ```
      {% endverbatim%}
        {% generate_challenge_thumbnail challenge_slug=â€˜<your_challengeâ€™s_slug>â€™ %}
      {% verbatim %}
    ```
